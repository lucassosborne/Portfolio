## Number Guessing Game
This is a project made in Python, throught the online software _Replit_. Here, the computer selects a secret random number from 1 to 10. You can type in a number as a guess, and the computer will give you a hint, based on whether your guess was higher or lower than the secret number. Keep going until you guess correctly!
